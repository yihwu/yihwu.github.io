I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Maryland advised by Prof. [Heng Huang](https://sites.pitt.edu/~heh45/), where I am currently conducting research on Trustworthy Machine Learning. My work revolves around exploring the application of this field in various areas, such as computer vision, graph neural networks, and large foundation models. I am fortunate to have the chance to collaborate with Prof. [Hongyang Zhang](https://hongyanz.github.io/) and Prof. [Aleksandar Bojchevski](https://abojchevski.github.io/).

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Maryland advised by Prof. [Heng Huang](https://sites.pitt.edu/~heh45/), where I am currently conducting research on Trustworthy Machine Learning. My work revolves around exploring the application of this field in various areas, such as computer vision, graph neural networks, and foundation models. I am fortunate to have the chance to collaborate with Prof. [Hongyang Zhang](https://hongyanz.github.io/) and Prof. [Aleksandar Bojchevski](https://abojchevski.github.io/).
